        <p className="text-gray-700">North Star Soccer Team is more than just a soccer club; it is a community-driven 
          initiative founded by the dedicated parents of Saint Mary Orthodox Eritrean Church. Our goal is to provide children 
          with an environment where they can socialize, develop physically and mentally, and grow with strong disciplineâ€”all while 
          enjoying the beautiful game of soccer. </p>
        
          <h6 className="text-1.5xl font-bold mt-4">Our Purpose</h6>

          <p className="text-gray-700">We believe that soccer is not just about competition but also about character-building, 
            teamwork, and personal growth. 
            Through regular training and matches, we encourage our players to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>âœ” Stay active and healthy.</li>
            <li>âœ” Build strong friendships.</li>
            <li>âœ” Develop discipline, responsibility, and teamwork.</li>
            <li>âœ” Improve their soccer skills in a supportive environment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-1.5xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Open to Everyone</p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">At North Star Soccer Team, we welcome all children who are interested in playing soccer.
             Our team is built on inclusivity and respect, and we firmly believe that sports should bring people together.
